# Speaking

I am passionate about what I do, and _love_ speaking about it, virtual or in-person. I'm not half bad at taking and answering questions, either. I'm also interested in taking part in podcast interviews.

Here's a handful of things I can't seem to stop talking about.

* Web Development
* Business Ownership
* WordPress & Javascript
* WordPress plugin & theme development
* RV life
* Managing WordPress clients

Alternatively, if you read any [blog](alexstandiford.com/blog/) content I've written, and would like me to discuss it as a talk, don't hesitate to reach out.
