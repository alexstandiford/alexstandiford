# Hi, I'm Alex

I am [Alex Standiford](https://www.alexstandiford.com). I’m a web developer originally from Dover, Ohio. I’ve been tinkering with web technologies my entire life, and started my career as a web developer in 2015.

Since then, I have built dozens of WordPress plugins, scratch-made websites, and web applications.

I am an active contributor to open source software in-general. Most of my contributions can be seen in WordPress, where I maintain a couple of plugins, contribute to a few other projects, and work on core WordPress features that interest me.

If you are interested in hiring me, or working with me in any way, you can contact me at alex@standiford.us.
Personal Life

These days, I live in a camper with my family. You'd probably call me a digital nomad, and I don't think I can disagree at this point. We've been on the road for over 3 years, and have seen a lot of stuff along the way. We talk about our exploits on Casual Weirdness, and share what we are have learned on the road, and on the land. It's a good life, exciting, and full of constant good weather.

I've been working in a remote work lifestyle for most of the last 5 years, and honestly I don't see myself ever going back to the office. There's just too much to see out there, too much to-do. Not to mention, I get to spend much more time with my two kids, my wife, and our pets.

When I’m not writing code, I am probably enjoying craft beer, playing disc golf, cooking, camping, or playing video games.
