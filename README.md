# Hi, I'm Alex

I am Alex Standiford. I’m a web developer from the little town of Dover, Ohio. I’ve been tinkering with web	technologies my entire life, and started my career as a web developer in 2015.

Since then, I have built dozens of WordPress plugins, scratch-made websites, and web applications.

I am an active contributor to WordPress, where I maintain a couple of plugins, make small updates to	documentation errors, and participate in WordCamp organization.

I spend most of my time working with the awesome people at [Sandhills	Development](<http://sandhillsdev.com>), or I’m serving my clients through my businesses – [DesignFrame Solutions](<https://designframesolutions.com/?ref=2>). If you are interested in hiring me to	build or customize your site, you can contact me at [hello@alexstandiford.com](<mailto:hello@alexstandiford.com>).

## Personal Life

I decided to switch to a remote-work and web development lifestyle in 2014 when my wife and I had our first	child. I just couldn’t stand spending so much time away from my family, especially since my son was so young,	and was usually asleep before I got home from work.

When I’m not writing code, I am probably enjoying craft beer, playing disc golf, sailing, or camping.

Beyond that, I spend most of my free time with my wife, my two sons, and my [fetch-loving Springer Spaniel, Phoebe.](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guDJU4E_g8>)
