# Hi, I'm Alex

I am Alex Standiford. I’m a web developer from the little town of Anywhere, USA. I’ve been tinkering with web	technologies my entire life, and started my career as a web developer in 2015.

Since then, I have built dozens of WordPress plugins, scratch-made websites, and web applications.

I am an active contributor to WordPress, where I maintain a couple of plugins, make small updates to	documentation errors, and participate in WordCamp organization.

If you are interested in hiring me, or working with me in any way, you can contact me at [alex@standiford.us](<mailto:alex@standiford.us>).

## Personal Life

These days, we live in a camper, and after a few months of traveling around the country, we've bought some raw land and started to set up an off grid home. We talk about our exploits on [Casual Weirdness](https://casualweirdness.life/), and share what we are have learned on the road, and on the land. It's a good life, exciting, and full of constant good weather.

I've been working in a remote work lifestyle for most of the last 5 years, and honestly I don't see myself ever going back to the office. There's just too much to see out there, too much to-do. Not to mention, I get to spend much more time with my two kids, my wife, and our pets.

When I’m not writing code, I am probably enjoying craft beer, playing disc golf, cooking, or camping.
