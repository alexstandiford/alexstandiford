# Hi, I'm Alex

I am Alex Standiford. I’m a web developer from the little town of Anywhere, USA. I’ve been tinkering with web	technologies my entire life, and started my career as a web developer in 2015.

Since then, I have built dozens of WordPress plugins, scratch-made websites, and web applications.

I am an active contributor to WordPress, where I maintain a couple of plugins, make small updates to	documentation errors, and participate in WordCamp organization.

I’m serving my clients through my businesses – [DesignFrame Solutions](https://www.designframesolutions.com/?ref=2), or putting in sweat equity in my [off grid life](https://www.casualweirdness.life/). I'm also spending a fair amount of time [building WordPress development courses at WP Dev Academy](https://www.wpdev.academy).

If you are interested in hiring me, or working with me in any way, you can contact me at [hello@alexstandiford.com](<mailto:hello@alexstandiford.com>).

## Personal Life

These days, we live in a camper, and after a few months of traveling around the country, we've bought some raw land and started to set up an off grid home. We talk about our exploits on [Casual Weirdness](https://casualweirdness.life/), and share what we are have learned on the road, and on the land. It's a good life, exciting, and full of constant good weather.

I've been working in a remote work lifestyle for most of the last 5 years, and honestly I don't see myself ever going back to the office. There's just too much to see out there, too much to-do. Not to mention, I get to spend much more time with my two kids, my wife, and our pets.

When I’m not writing code, I am probably enjoying craft beer, playing disc golf, cooking, or camping.
