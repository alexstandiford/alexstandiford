# Hi, I'm Alex

I am Alex Standiford. I’m a web developer from the little town of Dover, Ohio. I’ve been tinkering with web	technologies my entire life, and started my career as a web developer in 2015.

Since then, I have built dozens of WordPress plugins, scratch-made websites, and web applications.

I am an active contributor to WordPress, where I maintain a couple of plugins, make small updates to	documentation errors, and participate in WordCamp organization.

I spend most of my time working with the awesome people at [Sandhills	Development](<http://sandhillsdev.com>), or I’m serving my clients through my businesses – [DesignFrame Solutions](<https://designframesolutions.com/?ref=2>). If you are interested in hiring me to	build or customize your site, you can contact me at [hello@alexstandiford.com](<mailto:hello@alexstandiford.com>).

## Personal Life

These days, we live in a camper, and are traveling the country. We talk about our exploits on [Casual Weirdness](https://www.casualweirdness.life), and share what we are learning on the road. It's a good life, exciting, and full of constant good weather.

I've been working in a remote work lifestyle for most of the last 5 years, and honestly I don't see myself ever going back to the office. There's just too much to see out there, too much to-do. Not to mention, I get to spend much more time with my two kids, my wife, and our pets.

When I’m not writing code, I am probably enjoying craft beer, playing disc golf, cooking, or camping.
