# Current Projects

## At My Job

I started a new job, working on the [GoDaddy's E-commerce](https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/ecommerce-hosting) team. I've been here a few months now, and I'm really just now starting to get the hang of it. To be honest, this was a _really_ hard transition for me, much harder than I expected. I genuinely think I'm better for it, and now that I feel like I've got the initial learning curve behind me I'm rearin' to go.

## Personal

I bought a much bigger camper, and a new truck that can actually haul said camper. We're effectively doubling our square footage with this new rig. After much discussion, Kate and I decided that we just _aren't ready to stop this anytime soon_, and if we're going to be on the road then it's time to make an upgrade that will suit us for that timeframe. Our current rig is sufficient, but we're definitely starting to feel crammed in here. as the kids get older, they're starting to take up more space, and we anticipate that this is only going to continue to be a challenge as Devin grows. So, we got a big ol' fifth wheel that gives the kids their own room, gives us our own room, and includes suitable living areas for lounging, as well as a kitchen.

We're currently on week 6 in Dover making repairs and upgrades to the camper and are despearately wanting to get the heck out of here and back on the road. My routine is so jacked up right now.

## Online Courses at WP Dev Academy

I've started working on the expansions to turn WP Dev Academy into PressCademy, a WordPress specific course platform. If you want to publish courses, and earn passive income, [DEFINITELY check this out](https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1467627243593781251?s=20). I'll be sharing details as I publish them. I've been working on the website design off and on when I have time, and have started to formulate the phases in which the build needs to happen over the next few months. _Really_ excited about this!

Unfortunately, I haven't been working much on new course content lately. I've been putting what time I have into actuall getting the new PressCademy site up and running, which let me tell you, has been _quite an undertaking_. I intentionally set the scope for the initial launch to be what I'd consider "reasonable", but it's still a lot of work. But it will be worth it. The interface is really nice, and it's something that I'm genuinely proud of. I can't wait to share it.
