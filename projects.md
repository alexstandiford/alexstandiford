# Current Projects

## At My Job

I started a new job, working on the [GoDaddy's E-commerce](https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/ecommerce-hosting) team. I've been here a few months now, and I'm really just now starting to get the hang of it. To be honest, this was a _really_ hard transition for me, much harder than I expected. I genuinely think I'm better for it, and now that I feel like I've got the initial learning curve behind me I'm rearin' to go.

## Personal

Welp, [second summer](https://casualweirdness.life/second-summer-here-i-come/) is well on it's way. We've left our winter spot in Texas, and are now out east. We're basically waiting for Vermont to thaw enough for us to head that way.

One of [this year's goals](https://alexstandiford.com/blog/goals/2023-looking-forward/) is to purchase land in Vermont, and I've been working hard to get a stash of money to be able to put down toward that. I can't wait until April, because that's when we can really start looking at our options seriously. In the meantime, I'll [enjoy this lovely Georgia weather](https://fosstodon.org/@alexstandiford/109864727684807188).

## Side Hustle

Now that [DesignFrame is gone](https://alexstandiford.com/blog/business/so-long-designframe/), I have been able to focus on taking on more-appropriate clients for my skill set, and as a result I have started taking gigs [like this one](https://alexstandiford.com/blog/side-hustle/i-built-a-restful-events-integration-this-weekend/), solving problems for agencies when they have a need that is outside of their wheelhouse.

What extra "side hustle" time I have available goes toward tinkering with a NextJS-based version of this site. I have a vision of [turning my site into a central hub](https://alexstandiford.com/blog/fediverse/your-site-as-a-central-hub/), and a big part of that is having a headless setup that plays nicely with it. More on this in-time.
