# Current Projects

## At My Job

I've been putting most of my time into [AffiliateWP](https://www.affiliatewp.com), mostly working on modern Javascript in the [Affiliate Dashboard Pro Addon](https://affiliatewp.com/affiliate-dashboard-in-beta). It's been a fun project, and I've really enjoyed getting a chance to work alongside some really talented people at Sandhills.

## Personal

We're currently living in our travel trailer full-time, and are parked in western New Mexico.

From here, we are continuing west, up through California, and then back down into the south before Winter 2021. We've become quite comfortable with boondocking, and hauling the rig. Kate, my wife, [keeps our Instagram account updated](instagram.com/our_casual_weirdness/), and you can see some of the highlights of our journey.

## In My Business

DFS has picked up a bit, as we see the fruits of my labor earlier this year. I spent a fair amount of time revamping DesignFrame's website, improving the SEO, introducing an [affiliate program](https://designframesolutions.com/become-an-affiliate/), as well as a [plugin partnership program](https://designframesolutions.com/plugin-support-program/) for plugin companies looking for a boost in out-of-scope support. These efforts have given us a small influx of leads.

In-addition to that, I've spent a fair amount of this year fleshing out an upcoming WordPress plugin that we will be selling early next year, called FlareWP, as well as 
an open-source WordPress theme & plugin framework called [Underpin](https://github.com/alexstandiford/underpin). I talk about the benefits of Underpin [here](https://designframesolutions.com/how-underpin-keeps-technical-debt-low/).
