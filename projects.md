# Current Projects

## At My Job

I've been putting most of my time into [AffiliateWP](https://www.affiliatewp.com), mostly working on modern Javascript in the newly published [Affiliate Dashboard Pro Addon](https://affiliatewp.com/new-affiliate-portal-pro-add-on/). It was truly a fun build, and I've really enjoyed getting a chance to work alongside some really talented people at Sandhills. I got a chance to sharpen my [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) skills, which I have come to _really_ like when working with PHP-rendered content.

## Personal

After traveling over 3000 miles in the last 2 months, we're pretty tired of moving at the moment and have parked the RV for a 30-day respite in Northern California.

From here, we plan to continue north through the Pacific Northwest. We've become quite comfortable with boondocking, and hauling the rig. Kate, my wife, [keeps our Instagram account updated](instagram.com/our_casual_weirdness/), and you can see some of the highlights of our journey.

## In My Business

DFS has picked up a bit, as we see the fruits of my labor earlier this year. I spent a fair amount of time revamping DesignFrame's website, improving the SEO, introducing an [affiliate program](https://designframesolutions.com/become-an-affiliate/), as well as a [plugin partnership program](https://designframesolutions.com/plugin-support-program/) for plugin companies looking for a boost in out-of-scope support. These efforts have given us a small influx of leads.

For now, I have shelved FlareWP, as I have concluded that the extra load it puts on a WordPress database is still too great for me to be comfortable with installing it on other people's websites. With that, I am pivoting how I'm approaching this tool and will have something new with it later this year.

I also continue to work on an open-source WordPress theme & plugin framework called [Underpin](https://github.com/alexstandiford/underpin). I talk about the benefits of Underpin [here](https://designframesolutions.com/how-underpin-keeps-technical-debt-low/).
