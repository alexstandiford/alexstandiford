# Current Projects

## At My Job

I've been putting most of my time into [AffiliateWP](https://www.affiliatewp.com), mostly working on some [key block-based updates in the newest version of AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com/custom-affiliate-registration-forms/). It's been a fun change of pace to work on block-based things in AffiliateWP, and I'm _thrilled_ to see team Alf continue to commit to not only staying relevant - but working to remain as the best affiliate program on WordPress. I'm probably biased, but I'm also right. ;)

## Personal

We have moved to a plot of land in New Mexico, and had a [handful of struggles](https://casualweirdness.life/life-off-grid-in-new-mexico-week-1/) during our first week. We have persevered, and are now living out here with all of our basic needs met to stay here sustainably. In coming weeks, I hope to start to actually _enjoy_ the beautiful area we live in beyond the enjoyment I get just from being here.

Oh, and fast internet. I want some of that.

## My WordPress Development Agency, DesignFrame Solutions

DFS has been _really slow_ this year. Most of my work came from visiting WordCamps and due to the pandemic I am not doing that anymore. I have spent most of this year revitilizing DesignFrame's marketing strategies. We brought on a business partner who's focued on building out content and assisting with marketing on the site, I've done a lot of work on revamping the site, and have introduced a few key partnership programs. An [affiliate program](https://designframesolutions.com/become-an-affiliate/), a [plugin partnership program](https://designframesolutions.com/plugin-support-program/), and an [agency white label program](https://designframesolutions.com/wordpress-agency-white-label-program/). Finally, I added a pretty handy [instant quote tool](https://designframesolutions.com/quiz/) that allows people to get an estimate for a website instantly.

The slowness of this year has given me enough time to really focus on transitioning DesignFrame's strategy from a salesman-hustle kind of gig to a marketing, strategic business. I believe that in coming months these efforts will pay off.

## Online Courses at WP Dev Academy

In an 8-week period, I [launched my first course](https://www.wpdev.academy/course/beer-lister-plugin/), [published 7 blog posts](https://www.wpdev.academy/archives/), launched a memberhsip platform for WordPress developers, and set up an [affiliate program](https://www.wpdev.academy/affiliate-program/) for the platform. It was a wild ride getting it set up, _especailly since I was also dealing with moving onto our land at the same time_. Now that WP Dev Academy is set up, I have made a [commitment to my members](https://www.wpdev.academy/membership/premium/) to publish a few more courses this year, do some livestream events in our [Discord community](http://community.wpdev.academy/), and continue to keep a consistent content calendar moving on the site.

I have _lots_ of ideas to move forward with this community, and I'm really excited about it!
