# Current Projects

## At My Job

I've been putting most of my time into [AffiliateWP](https://www.affiliatewp.com), mostly working on modern Javascript in the newly published [Affiliate Dashboard Pro Addon](https://affiliatewp.com/new-affiliate-portal-pro-add-on/). It was truly a fun build, and I've really enjoyed getting a chance to work alongside some really talented people at Sandhills. I got a chance to sharpen my [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) skills, which I have come to _really_ like when working with PHP-rendered content.

## Personal

I spent most of the last month in Northern California, where I spent most of my available time recording, and working on a [WordPress plugin development course](https://www.alexstandiford.com/wordpress-plugin-course). I also played [a little disc golf](https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1387243607527100420) in a remote course deep in the mountains.

At the last possible second, we decided to head to New Mexico instead of continuing north. We're now parked in Northern New Mexico (we lovingly call it "New Mexicolorado"), where we'll be for at least the next month, maybe longer. We really love it here, and want to get to know the area a bit before we move on. I have absolutely no idea where we'll go after this.

## In My Business

DFS has picked up a bit, as we see the fruits of my labor earlier this year. I spent a fair amount of time revamping DesignFrame's website, improving the SEO, introducing an [affiliate program](https://designframesolutions.com/become-an-affiliate/), as well as a [plugin partnership program](https://designframesolutions.com/plugin-support-program/) for plugin companies looking for a boost in out-of-scope support. These efforts have given us a small influx of leads.

For now, I have shelved FlareWP, as I have concluded that the extra load it puts on a WordPress database is still too great for me to be comfortable with installing it on other people's websites. With that, I am pivoting how I'm approaching this tool and will have something new with it later this year.

I also continue to work on an open-source WordPress theme & plugin framework called [Underpin](https://github.com/alexstandiford/underpin). I talk about the benefits of Underpin [here](https://designframesolutions.com/how-underpin-keeps-technical-debt-low/).
