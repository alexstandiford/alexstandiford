# Current Projects

## At My Job

I've been putting most of my time into [AffiliateWP](https://www.affiliatewp.com), mostly working on modern Javascript in the [Affiliate Dashboard Pro Addon](https://affiliatewp.com/affiliate-dashboard-in-beta). It's been a fun project, and I've really enjoyed getting a chance to work alongside some really talented people at Sandhills.

## Personal

We're currently parked in Canyon Lake, TX, where we will remain for the remainder of Winter. I'm enjoying the warmer weather, but still somehow finding myself occasionally missing the Winter weather, at least until I see the actual temprature in Ohio.

From here, we plan on doing a big ol' year-long loop up north, and then back down into the south before Winter 2021. It seems like we change the route we're going to take every other week right now, but Kate came up with a really good one that I think we're going to stick to. Just gotta get more comfortable with boondocking.

## In My Business

The effects of COVID-19, and my inability to go to conferences finally caught up to us. This has been a very slow year for DFS, but honestly I've been fine with it. Nobody is counting on DesignFrame to earn a living right now, and the lack of business has given Trisha and me all year to re-align the business. I'm personally doubling down on traditional marketing efforts, and DesignFrame's [affiliate program](https://designframesolutions.com/become-an-affiliate/) in-hopes I can stop relying so heavily on gonig to conferences to bring in business.

In-addition to that, I've spent a fair amount of this year fleshing out an upcoming WordPress plugin that we will be selling early next year, called FlareWP, as well as 
an open-source WordPress theme & plugin framework called [Underpin](https://github.com/alexstandiford/underpin). I talk about the benefits of Underpin [here](https://designframesolutions.com/how-underpin-keeps-technical-debt-low/).

With these focuses, and product releases, I _finally_ made the time to really upgrade DesignFrame's website. I wrote a blog post about the tech behind it [here](https://designframesolutions.com/headless-wordpress-is-overrated-a-case-for-the-nearly-headless-web-app/).
