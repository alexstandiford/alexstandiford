# Current Projects

## At My Job

I started a new job, working on the [GoDaddy's E-commerce](https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/ecommerce-hosting) team. I figure if all these plugin companies are going to be bought out by bigger companies, I may as well make the switch _now_, on my terms. What I didn't expect was just how small the culture would feel, even though it's a part of a very large company. This is my first "corporate" job, so I was a little nervous. I have since discovered that this particular team is going to give me a chance to expand my knowledge both within WordPress, and beyond. I'm _really_ exacited about it.

## Personal

At the time of this writing, our respite in our familiar "texas home" in Canyon Lake has ended, and we are joyfully heading east. Far away from the (lovely, but unfamiliar) high desert, and western ecosystem we've been a part of for the past year, and heading back out east. Looking forward to a slower pace, and casually meandering our way up into New England, and maybe even Nova Scotia, depending on how bad COVID wants to make 2022 for travelers.

Still waiting on the rest of the parts for my solar system (damn supply chain) but I do have a pretty [sweet desk setup now](https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1459956409454546944) so there's that.

Oh also, [I got a guitar, and Kate got a mandolin](https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1465530212142170114). Don't ask how we found room to fit them in the camper.

Kate shared a post about the continued journey [here](https://casualweirdness.life/the-journey-continues/).

## Online Courses at WP Dev Academy

I've started working on the expansions to turn WP Dev Academy into Presscademy, a WordPress specific course platform. If you want to publish courses, and earn passive income, [DEFINITELY check this out](https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1467627243593781251?s=20). I'll be sharing details as I publish them. I've been working on the website design off and on when I have time, and have started to formulate the phases in which the build needs to happen over the next few months. _Really_ excited about this!

In an 8-week period, I [launched my first course](https://www.wpdev.academy/course/beer-lister-plugin/), [published 7 blog posts](https://www.wpdev.academy/archives/), launched a memberhsip platform for WordPress developers, and set up an [affiliate program](https://www.wpdev.academy/affiliate-program/) for the platform. It was a wild ride getting it set up, _especailly since I was also dealing with moving onto our land at the same time_. Now that WP Dev Academy is set up, I have made a [commitment to my members](https://www.wpdev.academy/membership/premium/) to publish a few more courses over the next year, do some livestream events in our [Discord community](http://community.wpdev.academy/), and continue to keep a consistent content calendar moving on the site.

Pre-orders for my [Nearly Headless WordPress theme course](https://www.wpdev.academy/course/build-a-nearly-headless-wordpress-site-using-alpinejs/) are available now, and I"m working on building this as we speak. This has required that I make some neat things, like [nicholas](github.com/alexstandiford/nicholas), a lightweight front-end routing and caching API. I've been sharing progress on some of the finer points of how the framework works [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1425996271836299264)
