# Current Projects

## At My Job

I'm currently looking for employment. You can see my resume [here](https://github.com/alexstandiford/alexstandiford/blob/main/resume.md). If you think I'm a good fit for your company, feel free to [message me on Twitter](twitter.com/alexStandiford) or shoot me an email at a@alexstandiford.com

## Personal

We have moved to a plot of land in New Mexico, and had a [handful of struggles](https://casualweirdness.life/life-off-grid-in-new-mexico-week-1/) during our first week. Shortly after getting all-set, we had a string of bad luck, and 13 things broke in 12 days, including [our refrigerator](https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1421146904423849987), two tires on my truck, and two generators. This was a pretty big setback, but we are coming out of it now.

## My WordPress Development Agency, DesignFrame Solutions

DFS has been _really slow_ this year. Most of my work came from visiting WordCamps and due to the pandemic I am not doing that anymore. I have spent most of this year revitilizing DesignFrame's marketing strategies. We brought on a business partner who's focued on building out content and assisting with marketing on the site, I've done a lot of work on revamping the site, and have introduced a few key partnership programs. An [affiliate program](https://designframesolutions.com/become-an-affiliate/), a [plugin partnership program](https://designframesolutions.com/plugin-support-program/), and an [agency white label program](https://designframesolutions.com/wordpress-agency-white-label-program/). Finally, I added a pretty handy [instant quote tool](https://designframesolutions.com/quiz/) that allows people to get an estimate for a website instantly.

The slowness of this year has given me enough time to really focus on transitioning DesignFrame's strategy from a salesman-hustle kind of gig to a marketing, strategic business. I believe that in coming months these efforts will pay off. Lots of pivoting coming soon.

## Online Courses at WP Dev Academy

In an 8-week period, I [launched my first course](https://www.wpdev.academy/course/beer-lister-plugin/), [published 7 blog posts](https://www.wpdev.academy/archives/), launched a memberhsip platform for WordPress developers, and set up an [affiliate program](https://www.wpdev.academy/affiliate-program/) for the platform. It was a wild ride getting it set up, _especailly since I was also dealing with moving onto our land at the same time_. Now that WP Dev Academy is set up, I have made a [commitment to my members](https://www.wpdev.academy/membership/premium/) to publish a few more courses over the next year, do some livestream events in our [Discord community](http://community.wpdev.academy/), and continue to keep a consistent content calendar moving on the site.

Pre-orders for my [Nearly Headless WordPress theme course](https://www.wpdev.academy/course/build-a-nearly-headless-wordpress-site-using-alpinejs/) are available now, and I"m working on building this as we speak. This has required that I make some neat things, like [nicholas](github.com/alexstandiford/nicholas), a lightweight front-end routing and caching API. I've been sharing progress on some of the finer points of how the framework works [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1425996271836299264)

I have _lots_ of ideas to move forward with this community, and I'm really excited about it!
